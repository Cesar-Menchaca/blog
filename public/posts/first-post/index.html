<p>My name&rsquo;s Cesar Menchaca, a college student with a passion for cybersecurity.
I am starting this blog as to document the things I do and learn along my
career. I do this in the hopes of sharing the things I learn with others and
providing a free learning resource to those just as passionate as me.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>I am a first-generation computer science college student who works part-time as
a SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst. Before that, I have worked as an
intern software developer, where I mainly worked on a project automating the
existing workflow. Along with cybersecurity, my interests include video games,
fiddling with my guitar, and working out.</p>
<h2 id="howd-i-start-in-cybersecurity">How&rsquo;d I start in cybersecurity<a href="#howd-i-start-in-cybersecurity" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>My first exposure to cybersecurity was with the game &ldquo;Watch Dogs&rdquo;, a Ubisoft
game released in 2014, where the main character was a hacker vigilante. When I
saw the game as a kid, I thought it was the coolest thing ever. However, I
didn&rsquo;t get to play the game until 4 years later, so all I could do at the time
was learn more about what hacking was through my limited access to the internet.
That&rsquo;s when I discovered that hacking was also performed in the real-world, and
I was the captivated by the creative ways people were able to manipulate
programs and machines so that they did things they weren&rsquo;t supposed to. When
I discovered that people do this work for a living, I knew that it was something
that I wanted to do it as a career. Once I had access to reliable internet in
high school, I kicked off my career by learning my first programming language,
Python. Fast forward to today, and I am currently working on research for
forensics on IoT (Internet of Things) devices at my current university while
also working as a SOC analyst, my first security job. My goal is to work
at the highest levels of security, where I develop the tools that protect
companies and where I secure the world&rsquo;s largest networks. Now that I had time
to reflect, I feel like I have made strides in reaching this goal, but I also
know that I have a long way to go.</p>
